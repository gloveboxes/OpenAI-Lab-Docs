# Explore the OpenAI GPT Models

**[Click here to begin the workshop](https://revodavid.github.io/OpenAI-Lab-UCB/)**


This session is a 60-minute live demonstration of interaction with OpenAI models GPT3 (text-davinci-003) and ChatGPT (gpt-3.5-turbo). You can follow along with the demonstration live using Use [Azure AI Studio](https://oai.azure.com/portal) or [OpenAI Playground](https://platform.openai.com/playground), or work through the examples in this repository later at your own pace and schedule.

The goal of this 60-minute session is to:
  * Understand the implementation and capabilities of GPT3 and ChatGPT
  * Learn how to use and customize natural language generative AI models using prompt engineering techniques
  * Understand the basics of integrating OpenAI models into applications with the API

## Pre-requisites

You will need an Azure Account or an OpenAI account to complete this lab. If you do not have an Azure Account, you can create one for free [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/), and request access to Azure OpenAI Service [here](https://aka.ms/oai/access).

See the [Setup](docs/0%20Setup.md) module for further details.

# Building the Lab Webpages

## Docs published on GitHub Pages

Docs are published on [GitHub Pages](https://revodavid.github.io/OpenAI-Lab-UCB/)

## Docusaurus

This website is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

### Installation

```
$ yarn
```

### Local Development

```
$ yarn start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Build

```
$ yarn build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

### Deployment

Using SSH:

```
$ USE_SSH=true yarn deploy
```

Not using SSH:

```
$ GIT_USER=<Your GitHub username> yarn deploy
```

If you are using GitHub pages for hosting, this command is a convenient way to build the website and push to the `gh-pages` branch.
