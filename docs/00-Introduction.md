# Explore the OpenAI GPT Models

This session is a 60-minute live demonstration of interaction with the OpenAI models GPT3 (text-davinci-003) and ChatGPT (gpt-3.5-turbo). You can follow along with the demonstration live using Use [Azure AI Studio](https://oai.azure.com/portal) or [OpenAI Playground](https://platform.openai.com/playground), or work through the examples in this repository later at your own pace and schedule.

The goal of this 60-minute session is to:
  * Understand the implementation and capabilities of GPT3 and ChatGPT
  * Learn how to use and customize natural language generative AI models using prompt engineering techniques
  * Understand the basics of integrating OpenAI models into applications with the API
